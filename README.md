# MetropolizedForestRecom.jl

The repository contiunes the development of the code initial housed in the repository [multiscalemapsampler-public](https://git.math.duke.edu/gitlab/quantifyinggerrymandering/multiscalemapsampler-public). This algorithm was developed in a series of articles: [Metropolized Forest Recombination for Monte Carlo Sampling of Graph Partitions](https://doi.org/10.1137/21M1418010) and [Metropolized Multiscale Forest Recombination for Redistricting](https://doi.org/10.1137/21M1406854).
